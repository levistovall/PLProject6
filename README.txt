Notes on Part 2 of Problem 1:
	For the if functionality, the if token must appear first and be followed by a boolean
	and exactly two values. In addition to the standard boolean tokens, any positive integer 
	will serve as a boolean with value true, and zero will serve as a boolean with value false.
