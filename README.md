let in PLY and expression processing

Part 1 of Problem 1 sends an error message if the user tries to set a variable and then evaluate on a different variable 
Example: (let (a 5)(+ b 1)) will return "Error, ensure 'let' variable matches expression variable"
Also, we added in subtraction and multiplaction support for binary operations
